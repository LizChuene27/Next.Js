      <p>Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Liz Chuene, a passionate accountant turned aspiring full-stack developer, with a thirst for knowledge and a heart full of wanderlust. This site is where I share my adventures, both in the world of technology and the great outdoors of Limpopo, South Africa.</p>
      <p>On my journey as an accountant, I discovered my love for numbers and finance, but I also realized that I craved something more dynamic and creative. Embracing my adventurous spirit, I decided to take on the challenge of becoming a full-stack developer. Here, you'll find updates on my coding endeavors, projects, and experiences as I dive into the exciting world of software development.</p>
      <p>But that's not all! Beyond the digital realm, I find solace in exploring the breathtaking landscapes of my beloved Limpopo. From hiking through lush forests to capturing the essence of its vibrant culture, nature fuels my creativity and inspires me in every way.</p>
      <p>I believe in pushing the boundaries, trying new things, and daring to dream big. Whether it's writing lines of code or conquering a steep mountain trail, I'm always up for an adventure.</p>
