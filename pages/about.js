      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello, there! I'm Liz Chuene, a 27-year-old with a passion for numbers, technology, and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve. Born and raised in the vibrant province of Limpopo, South Africa, I've always been inspired by the beauty of my surroundings and the spirit of adventure that fills the air.</p>
      <p>My journey began with a degree in accounting, but my heart was yearning for something more dynamic and creative. Driven by my brave and adventurous nature, I took a leap of faith and decided to pursue my passion for technology, envisioning myself as a full-stack developerâ€”a master of both front-end and back-end development.</p>
      <p>While on this exhilarating path to becoming a full-stack developer, I also acquired certifications in UX design, which made me more determined to create innovative and user-friendly applications.</p>
      <p>I thrive in fast-paced environments, where problem-solving and creativity go hand in hand. Beyond my professional pursuits, you'll often find me exploring the breathtaking landscapes of Limpopo, hiking through its majestic trails, and appreciating the rich cultural heritage that surrounds me. Nature fuels my soul and inspires my work, reminding me that every challenge is an opportunity for growth.</p>
      <p>As I continue my journey to becoming a full-stack developer, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. Combining financial expertise with a passion for technology, I aim to create innovative solutions that bridge the gap between finance and cutting-edge software development.</p>
      <p>In this ever-evolving world of technology, I am ready to make my mark and embrace every adventure that comes my way. With determination, courage, and a thirst for knowledge, I am determined to carve a path that leaves a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
